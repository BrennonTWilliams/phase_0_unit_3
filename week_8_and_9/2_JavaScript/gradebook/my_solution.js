/*
U3.W8-9: Gradebook from Names and Scores

You will work with the following two variables.  The first, students, holds the names of four students.  
The second, scores, holds groups of test scores.  The relative positions of elements within the two 
variables match (i.e., 'Joseph' is the first element in students; his scores are the first value in scores.).

Do not alter the students and scores code.

I worked on this challenge by myself

var students = ["Joseph", "Susan", "William", "Elizabeth"]

var scores = [ [80, 70, 70, 100],
               [85, 80, 90, 90],
               [75, 70, 80, 75],
               [100, 90, 95, 85] ]






// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.

function average (array){

  var total = 0;
  for(var i in array){
    total += array[i];
  }
  avg = total/array.length;
  return avg;
}

var gradebook = {

  addScore: function(name, score){this[name].testScores.push(score);},
  getAverage: function(name){ return average(this[name].testScores);},
  Joseph: {testScores: scores[0]},
  Susan: {testScores: scores[1]},
  William: {testScores: scores[2]},
  Elizabeth: {testScores: scores[3]}
};

// __________________________________________
// Refactored Solution

/*
I'm not sure how to refactor this, its a pretty terse solution. I
did some research and there are a bunch of ways to iterate through the 
array for the average function, but none of them seemed to have any
clear advantage over the way I did it.
*/



// __________________________________________
// Reflect

/*
This problem took my a surprisingly long time, I'm a bit alarmed by how
quickly I forgot the Javascript we learned a few weeks ago. I caught myself
thinking in Ruby more than once for this assignment. Previously I've favored
CoffeeScript over Javascript so my JVS experience is super limited. I plan on
taking a couple hours this week to refresh.
